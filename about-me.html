    My name is Brian Espinosa and yes that kook up there is me. You may be thinking "Brian, how could you be a coding noob if you have a degree alerady?". Well thats because my degree is in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, something not even remotely related to computer science. You see, I originally had a goal of joining the medical field, and was all set and ready to do it. I had got a 3.5 in college in a tough major, I scored in the 98 percentile on my MCAT, I had spent time volunteering, yada yada yada.
