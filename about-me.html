    My name is Brian Espinosa and yes that kook up there is me. You may be thinking "Brian, how could you be a coding noob if you have a degree already?". Well thats because my degree is in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, something not even remotely related to computer science (which I'm sure is like many of you guys). You see, I originally had a goal of joining the medical field, and was all set and ready to do it. I had got a 3.5 in college in a tough major, I scored in the 98 percentile on my MCAT, I had spent time volunteering, yada yada yada. Then I finally accepted that I do not want to be a doctor, the work is just not for me. Computers on the other hand I love and always Have.

    I built my first computer when I was 11 years old and spent basically my entire life with that same computer, just upgrading it along the way. I spent way, wayyy, wayyyyyyy too much time sitting on that computer as a kid. I tinkered in everything. I installed OS x on it, ubuntu, ran a World of Warcraft private server for awhile. Anyways, the point is, I freaking love computers and it has taken me this long to finally to the realization that I want to spend my life studying and building stuff for them. So here I am deciding to write a blog about my journey into the field. I decided to do this not only so I had a reason to reflect on what I learned, but because I know that it is very stressful not knowing what to do in life, and I hope this blog can show someone that with enough willpower, they can learn whatever they want.
