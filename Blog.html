        I guess this is my first post. Hang with me here as I have never done this before... Welcome to the beginning of the journey and congratulations on having found this website. As you can probably tell by how it looks in here, I am not very good at CSS. But hey I guess as an added bonus that means that you lovely people get to hopefully witness the transformation of this website from trash to something.

        For starters, let's set the stage with what I know as of today. I know a little bit of java and am currently taking an intro to java course at a local community college. I know a little of python, just by dabbling in it a little bit and doing some exercises from <a href="https://coderbyte.com" target="_blank">coderbyte.com</a> with it. I know some CSS and HTML, which I have learned from a different tutorial called <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial" target="_blank">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a> which I very highly recommend. Thats about it in terms of my current knowledge.

        My philosophy on learning coding is to be project based. Project based learning is basically the trial by fire version of learning. For example this blog, it is a project - a project that should teach me a significant amount of CSS and the intracacies of running a website. As a consequence this blog will likely be about my journey through these projects that I intend to create; but I don't really know what it's going to become to be honest. I am kind of just #chargingit. The first goal I have is to make this website look somewhat professional, which as of now it obviously doesn't. My knowledge of CSS is very basic but I have learned quite a lot so far just by building this super basic site. One major issue I'm having is figuring out how to add pictures with captions inside my blog post. I have tried using the <code style="color: blue;">figure</code> and <code style="color: blue;">figcap</code> tags to no avail. I also tried creating a box on the right side of the page to add an image and caption underneath within the box, which also didn't work because it made the paragraphs inside the actual blog post look weird.

        So my first goal is to make the site look and feel somewhat functional. I found a good course online called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a> which is a ruby on rails course. So far it has been super informative and it kind of has a bootcamp-like set up without the boot camp. It is very well structured and I very highly recommend it to anyone looking into developing websites. Another coding resource I'd like to shoutout is the podcast <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast">Code Newbies</a>. It's a podcast that basically interviews different developers in different spheres of the tech world about there journey and it has given me a ton of inspiration on my own journey. Thanks for reading through my first post and I hope you check back again. Hopefully within a couple weeks I will have an email list going and a site that has java-script incorporated into it. Until then, happy coding!
