        I guess this is my first post. Hang with me here as I have never done this before... Welcome to the beginning of the journey and congratulations on having found this website. As you can probably tell by how it looks in here, I am not very good at CSS. But hey I guess as an added bonus that means that you lovely people get to hopefully witness the transformation of this website from trash to something.

        For starters, lets set the stage with what I know as of today. I know a little bit of java and am currently taking an intro to java course at a local community college. I know a little of python, just by dabbling in it a little bit and doing some exercises from <a href="coderbyte.com">coderbyte.com with it</a> \. I know some CSS and HTML, which I have learned from a different tutorial called <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a> which i very highly reccomend. thats about it in terms of my current knowledge.
